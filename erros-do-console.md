Hello Claude,
You've built an excellent lovable.dev-style trading application, "Alpha-Learner v2.4," which now integrates with Supabase. The application is running, but it's encountering a critical runtime error when trying to save data.
The Core Problem:
The browser console shows 400 (Bad Request) errors from Supabase. The error messages clearly indicate a schema mismatch:
message: "Could not find the 'entry_time' column of 'signals' in the schema cache"
message: "Could not find the 'reason' column of 'audit_logs' in the schema cache"
This means the JavaScript code is trying to insert data into columns that do not exist in the Supabase database tables.
Your Task:
I need you to perform two key actions:
1. Create a SUPABASE_SETUP.md File:
Create a new markdown file named SUPABASE_SETUP.md. This file will be the definitive guide for setting up the Supabase database schema correctly to work with the application. It must contain clear, step-by-step SQL instructions.
The markdown file should include:
A brief introduction explaining the purpose of the file.
A section for the signals table schema, including the missing entry_time column (timestamptz).
A section for the audit_logs table schema, including the missing reason column (text).
Instructions on how to use the Supabase SQL Editor to run these scripts.
Crucially, review the entire JavaScript code to identify ALL properties being saved to Supabase for both signals and audit_logs tables. Ensure the SQL schemas in the markdown file are complete and perfectly match the data objects in the JavaScript code. For example, if the JS object has riskReward, the table should have a risk_reward column.
Example SUPABASE_SETUP.md structure:

# Alpha-Learner Supabase Schema Setup

This guide provides the necessary SQL scripts to correctly set up your Supabase database tables for the Alpha-Learner application.

### How to Use
1.  Navigate to your Supabase project.
2.  Go to the "SQL Editor" section.
3.  Click "+ New query".
4.  Copy and paste the scripts below and click "RUN".

### 1. `signals` Table

This table stores every trading signal generated by the Alpha Engine.

```sql
-- SQL script for the signals table
CREATE TABLE public.signals (
    id double precision NOT NULL,
    timestamp timestamptz NOT NULL,
    symbol text,
    direction text,
    score double precision,
    price double precision,
    stop_loss double precision,
    take_profit double precision,
    entry_time timestamptz, -- Missing column
    -- ... add ALL other necessary columns here based on the JS object ...
    CONSTRAINT signals_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

---

### 2. `audit_logs` Table

This table stores detailed audit information for analysis and debugging.

```sql
-- SQL script for the audit_logs table
CREATE TABLE public.audit_logs (
    signal_id double precision NOT NULL,
    generated_at timestamptz,
    reason text, -- Missing column
    -- ... add ALL other necessary columns here based on the JS object ...
    CONSTRAINT audit_logs_pkey PRIMARY KEY (signal_id)
);
```
2. Provide the Corrected index.html File:
Review the existing index.html file. While the primary error is in the database schema, ensure there are no related issues in the JavaScript code. For instance, verify that the objects being passed to the Supabase client (supabase.from('...').insert(...)) are correctly formatted. Provide the final, clean, and fully functional index.html file.
Final Deliverables:
The complete content for the SUPABASE_SETUP.md file.
The complete and final version of the index.html file.
